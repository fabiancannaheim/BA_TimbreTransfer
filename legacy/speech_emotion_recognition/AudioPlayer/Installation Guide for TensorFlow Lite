# Installation Guide for CocoaPods and TensorFlow Lite on Swift

## Install Command Line Tools for Xcode
Open a terminal and enter `xcode-select --install` to install the necessary Xcode command line tools if you haven't already.

## Install CocoaPods
Use `sudo gem install cocoapods` to install CocoaPods, the dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

## Set Up Your Workspace
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and execute `pod init` to create a Podfile for your project. After creating a Podfile, run `pod install` to generate an `.xcworkspace` file. Always open the project by using the `.xcworkspace` file henceforth to include the pods in your project build.

## Configure Your Podfile
Make the following changes in your Podfile:

# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '16.4'

target 'YourAppName' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'TensorFlowLiteSwift'

  # Pods for YourAppName

  target 'YourAppNameTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
    # Pods for testing
  end

  target 'YourAppNameUITests' do
    # Pods for testing
  end
end

Replace 'YourAppName' with the actual name of your app target. After updating the Podfile, run pod update to ensure all pods are up to date.

##Integrate TensorFlow Lite
Copy the TensorFlow Lite framework files generated by CocoaPods into your project directory. 
Use import TensorFlowLite at the beginning of your Swift files where you want to use TensorFlow Lite functionality.
