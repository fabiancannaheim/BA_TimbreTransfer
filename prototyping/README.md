# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks in this directory are used for prototyping, data analysis, and model training experiments. They provide an interactive environment to explore data, test models, and document the research process.

## Contents

- Exploratory data analysis notebooks.
- Model training and evaluation notebooks.
- Demonstration notebooks for project features.

## Guidelines

When adding a new notebook, please include a brief description at the top explaining its purpose and key findings.

It's common to start with notebooks for experimentation and prototyping. As the code matures and we identify parts that need to be reused or integrated into the application, one can refactor these into more structured scripts or source code modules. This process involves cleaning up the code, removing the interactive exploration parts, and ensuring it can run independently or as part of your application's codebase.

Here's a simplified flow of how code might evolve in the project:

### Experimentation and Prototyping
Start with notebooks to try out ideas, visualize data, and prototype model training.

### Stabilization and Reusability
Move stable and reusable code into scripts or the /src directory. This includes utility functions, model definitions, and data preprocessing code.

### Integration and Application Development
Integrate the stable code into your Swift app or use it as part of the backend logic that your app interacts with.

This structure and workflow support a clear separation of concerns, making the project easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.
